# Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. 
# It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.

# In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. 
# This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

# How does Merge Sort work?
# Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. It follows the divide-and-conquer approach to sort a given array of elements.

# Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:

# Divide: Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
# Conquer: Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm.
# Merge: The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged.


# Divide: 

# [38, 27, 43, 10]  is divided into  [38, 27  ] and  [43, 10]  . 
# [38, 27]  is divided into  [38]  and  [27]  . 
# [43, 10]  is divided into  [43]  and  [10]  . 

# Conquer: 

# [38]  is already sorted. 
# [27]  is already sorted. 
# [43]  is already sorted. 
# [10]  is already sorted.
 
# Merge: 

# Merge  [38]  and  [27]  to get  [27, 38]  . 
# Merge  [43]  and  [10]  to get  [10,43]  . 
# Merge  [27, 38]  and  [10,43]  to get the final sorted list  [10, 27, 38, 43] 

# Therefore, the sorted list is  [10, 27, 38, 43]  .
